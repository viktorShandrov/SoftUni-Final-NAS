# SoftUni-Final-NAS
This is my Angular Final Project.

Google Drive has inspired the project.

The primary purpose is to upload and share files and folders among users.

It has a custom implementation of hover, left and right clicking on files and folders.

Main features:
 - Dashboard
 - Storage
 - Shared with me
 - Shared with users
   
### Dashboard
Overview: 
  This feature gives you the ability to see how much of your storage is being used, how much is your total storage to spare, and how much storage is left. 
  There are two charts. One is to display the top 3 folders with the most files in it and the second is what are the most common file extensions in the entire user storage.  
  
### Storage
Overview: 
  This is the main section for the users. They can right-click and from the menu select what they want to create - a folder or file.
  According to their choice, a different form is displayed.
  In the UI are included visual effects similar to windows file explorer.

  From the right-click menu you can delete and share the folder while files can only be deleted.

### Shared with me
Overview: 
  You can view all the folders that are being shared with you. When you enter the folder, only the files in it are shown and you cannot make changes to them.  
  
### Shared with users
Overview: 
  You can view all the folders that are being shared with other users from your storage. In this section, there is one table showing records for shared folders and the user with whom is being shared. There is an "unauthorize" button. When pressed, the user has no further access to that folder.
